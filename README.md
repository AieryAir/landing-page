Yeah, yeah

Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Girl, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream girl
You make flowers bloom
Girl, you make the stars collide
And I don't know what I did to get lucky like this
But it sure feels fine

'Cause you give me love and affection
I give you all my protection
I'm tryna stay by your side 'til the day I die
And you give me all of your love
And I give you all of my trust
I know you'll never betray me or leave my side, oh my

Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Girl, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream girl
You make flowers bloom (Girl, you make the flowers bloom)
Girl, you make the stars collide (Don't you know you make the stars collide?)
And I don't know what I did to get lucky like this
But it sure feels fine

'Cause I see your face when I'm sleepin'
I wake up grateful to breathe in
The air you float through, I wrote you a lullaby
A song to sing on your pillow
Swift as a swing on a willow
My sweetest words are mere birds in your perfect sky, oh my

Baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Girl, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream girl
You make flowers bloom (Girl, you make the flowers bloom)
Girl, you make the stars collide (Well, don't you know you make the stars collide?)
And I don't know what I did to get lucky like this
But it sure feels fine (Sure feels fine)
'Cause baby, baby, you're my sun and moon
Girl, you're everything between
A lot of pretty faces could waste my time
But you're my dream girl
You make flowers bloom (Girl, you make the flowers bloom)
Girl, you make the stars collide (Well, don't you know you make the stars collide?)
And I don't know what I did to get lucky like this
But it sure feels fine, oh my, oh my

Oh my
Oh my, oh my, yeah
Oh my, oh my
Baby, baby, you're mine
